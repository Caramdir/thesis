\section{Microlocal theory of perverse coherent sheaves}

This project is motivated by two theories that came to recent prominence in algebraic geometry and in particular geometric representation theory.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The notion of perverse coherent sheaves, independently introduced by Bezrukavnikov (following Deligne) \cite{ArinkinBezrukavnikov:2010:PerverseCoherentSheaves}, Kashiwara \cite{Kashiwara:2004:tStructureOnHolonomicDModuleCoherentOModules}, Gabber \cite{Gabber:2004:NotesOnSomeTStructures} and Bridgeland \cite{Bridgeland:2006:DerivedCategoriesOfCoherentSheaves}.
    \item A theory of \enquote{singular support} for coherent sheaves, worked out by Arinkin and Gaitsgory for their formulation of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture \cite{ArinkinGaitsgory:2015:SingularSupport}, based on earlier work by Benson--Iyengar--Krause \cite{BensonIyengarKrause:2008:LocalCohomologyAndSupportForTriangulatedCategories}\todo{Also reference Eisenbud?}.
\end{itemize}
Removing the word \enquote{coherent}, these two theories are by now classical and indispensable tools in the study of constructible sheaves.
They can also be beautifully combined to elucidate the microlocal nature of perverse sheaves \cite{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds}.
Thus the question naturally arises whether the coherent versions of these theories can be combined too.

Coming form representation theory, we will be primarily concerned with the definition of perverse coherent sheaves by Bezrukavnikov, which we will recall below.
However we should note from the outset that the Arinkin--Gaitsgory theory of singular support does not interact well with these perverse coherent sheaves.
For example the perverse t-structure on $\SL2$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $\as2$ is non-trivial, but the singular support of coherent sheaves on either $\as2$ or the stack $\as2/\SL2$ is always trivial.
Thus we have to understand the microlocal nature of perverse coherent sheaves in a different way.

\subsection{Perverse (constructible) sheaves}

Before discussing our results, let us briefly review the theory of perverse sheaves in the setting that is closed to the coherent analogue that we will use.
For readability, we will restrict to the complex case and the middle perversity.

Thus we le $X$ be a complex variety and fix a stratification $\setset S$ of $X$ be smooth complex subvarieties.
Attached to this setup we have the bounded derived category of $\dconstrb[\setset S]{X}$ of $\setset S$-constructible sheaves, i.e.~the full subcategory of the category of constructible sheaves on $X$ of sheaves which are local systems along each stratum.
The \emph{perverse t-structure} on this category is then given by the two full subcateogries
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \label{eq:intro:pc:constructible_t-structure}
        \dpconstr{\setset S}{\le 0}{X} &=
        \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ \dconstrb[\setset S]{X} : i_S^* \sheaf F ∈ \dcat{\le -\frac12\dim_ℝ S}{S} \text{ for all } S ∈ \setset S\bigr\}, \\
        \dpconstr{\setset S}{\ge 0}{X} &=
        \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ \dconstrb[\setset S]{X} : i_S^! \sheaf F ∈ \dcat{\ge -\frac12\dim_ℝ S}{S} \text{ for all } S ∈ \setset S\bigr\}, \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $i_S\colon S \hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion.
That this is indeed a t-structure was proved by Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne in \cite{BeilinsonBernsteinDeligne:1982:FaisceauxPervers}.
In particular this means that the category
\[
    \PervConstr[\setset S]{X} = \dpconstr{\setset S}{\le 0}{X} ∩ \dpconstr{\setset S}{\ge 0}{X}
\]
is Abelian.
It is called the category of \emph{(middle) perverse sheaves} on $X$ with respect to $\setset S$.
This category both intimately connected to the singularities of $X$ (via intersection cohomology) and, if $X$ is smooth, the category of D-modules on $X$ (via the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence).
It has many nice properties, of which we want to mention the following two which are of particular importance in the coherent analogue.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Verdier duality functor on $\dconstrb[\setset S](X)$ restricts to an involution of $\PervConstr[\setset S]{X}$.
    \item The simple objects of $\PervConstr[\setset S]{X}$ are in bijection with pairs $(S, \sheaf L)$ consisting of a stratum $S ∈ \setset S$ and an irreducible local system on $\sheaf L$ on $S$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Perverse coherent sheaves}

With some modification the definition of perverse sheaves can be translated to coherent sheaves.
We will again only discuss the middle perversity here.
The general definition will be reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:pc:pre:pc}.

We let $X$ be a scheme of finite type over a field $k$.
We would like to pick a stratification of $X$ and consider the category of coherent sheaves whose restriction to each stratum is a vector bundle.
Unfortunately this is not a triangulated subcategory of $\dcohb{X}$.
For example for a general function $f$ the cone of $\O_X \xrightarrow{\cdot f} \O_X$ will not be a vector bundle on the open stratum.

The solution to this problem is to introduce a group action replace \enquote{smoothness along a stratification} by \enquote{equivariantness}.
Thus we let $G$ be an affine algebraic group over $k$ acting on $X$ and consider the bounded derived category $\dcohbG{X} = \dcohb{X/G}$ of $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $X$.
Instead of the strata $S ∈ \setset S$ we will look at the set $\Xtop$ of generic points of $G$-equivariant subschemes of $X$.

In the constructible setting we used required the stratification to be complex, so that we could have the (real) dimension.
He we will require directly that all $G$-orbits are even-dimensional.
The main example of this situation is the nilpotent cone of a semi-simple algebraic group with the adjoint action.

The only piece remaining to translate from the constructible setting are the restriction functors.
For this it turns out that the $\O$-module functors do not give the correct definition and we have to use the $k$-module functors instead.
Thus, if $ι_x\colon \{x\} → X$ is the inclusion of $x ∈ \Xtop$ and $\sheaf F ∈ \dcohbG{X}$, we let $\mathbf ι_x^* \sheaf F = \sheaf F_x$ be the (derived) functor of talking stalks.
Similarly, we let $\mathbf ι_x^!\sheaf F = \mathbf ι_x^* \lc{\bar{\{x\}}} \sheaf F$ be the derived functor of local cohomology.
Thus the definition~\eqref{eq:intro:pc:constructible_t-structure} becomes the two full subcategories
\begin{align*}
    \dpc{≤0}{X} & =
    \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ \dcohb{X} : \mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F ∈ \dcat{≤ -\frac12 \dim x}{\O_x} \text{ for all $x ∈ \Xtop$}\bigr\}, \\
    \dpc{≥0}{X} & =
    \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ \dcohb{X} : \mathbf ι_x^!\sheaf F ∈ \dcat{≥ -\frac12 \dim x}{\O_x} \text{ for all $x ∈ \Xtop$}\bigr\},
\end{align*}
and this is indeed a t-structure \cite{ArinkinBezrukavnikov:2010:PerverseCoherentSheaves}.
The heart of this t-structure is called the category of \emph{(middle) perverse sheaves} on $X$.
It is again an Abelian category with lots of interesting features.
In particular we have the same properties as above:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Grothendieck-Serre duality is an involution of the category of perverse coherent sheaves.
    \item For sufficiently nice $G$-actions the simple objects are indexed by pairs $(O, \sheaf V)$, where $O$ is a G-orbit and $\sheaf V$ is an irreducible $G$-equivariant vector bundle on $O$ (or equivalently an irreducible representation of the stabilizer of $G$ on $O$).
\end{itemize}
Bezrukavnikov used the second property in \cite{Bezrukavnikov:2003:QuasiExceptionalSets} to establish a bijection between pairs $(O, V)$ of a nilpotent orbit $O$ and an irreducible representation $V$ of the stabilizer of $G$ on $O$, and the set $Λ^+$ of dominant weight of $G$, thus proving a conjecture of Lusztig.

\section{Hochschild cohomology of categories of D-modules}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Why study $\HCoh\left(\catDMod{\stack X}\right)$?
    \item Naive expectation and its problems.
    \item Statement of result.
    \item Outline of approach?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Short summary}

Let $\stack X$ be a stack.
The goal of the second part is to understand the Hochschild cohomology
\[
    \HCoh\bigl(\catDMod{\stack X}\bigr)
    =
    \Hom_{\catDMod{\stack X × \stack X}}(Δ_* ω_{\stack X},\, Δ_* ω_{\stack X}).
\]
By duality and adjunction this is the same as
\[
    \opalg{\Hom_{\catDMod{\stack X}}(k_{\stack X},\, Δ^!Δ_! k_{\stack X})} =
    \opalg{\ΓdR(\stack X,\, Δ^!Δ_! k_{\stack X})}.
\]
For this we consider the (derived) loop space
\[
    \ls \stack X = \stack X ×\limits_{\stack X × \stack X} \stack X
\]
and the Cartesian diagram
\[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \ls \stack X \arrow[r, "p₁"] \arrow[d, "p₂"] & \stack X \arrow[d, "Δ"] \\
        \stack X \arrow[r, "Δ"] & \stack X × \stack X
    \end{tikzcd}
\]
Naively, one could expect that
\[
    \opalg{\ΓdR(\stack X,\, Δ^!Δ_! k_{\stack X})} \cong
    \opalg{\ΓdR(\stack X,\, p_{2,!}p₁^! k_{\stack X})},
\]
but of course this base-change isomorphism does not exist in general.

We will try to quantify how much the morphism $p_{2,!}p₁^! k_{\stack X} → Δ^!Δ_! k_{\stack X}$ fails to be an isomorphism.
In particular we will show that it is an isomorphism for stacks of the form $\stack X = [X/\Gm^n]$.

\begin{Thm}\label{thm:d-mod:main}
    Let $G$ be a torus acting locally linearly on a scheme $X$ of finite type over $k$.
    Then there is a canonical isomorphism of algebras
    \[
        \HCoh\bigl(\catDMod{X/G}\bigr)
        \cong
        \opalg{\ΓdR\bigl(X/G,\,p_{2,!} p₁^! k_{X/G}\bigr)}.
    \]
\end{Thm}
