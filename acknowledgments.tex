\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I want to thank my advisor David Nadler.
His support and encouragement as well as his inexhaustible supply of interesting mathematics to think about has been invaluable
Much of what I know I learned from him and his writing.

The projects constituting this thesis have benefited from discussions with Pramod Achar, Dennis Gaitsgory, Sam Gunningham and Nick Rozenblyum.
They are made possible by the work of many great mathematicians, but in particular by the work of Dima Arinkin, Vladimir Drinfeld and Dennis Gaitsgory.
The first part has benefited greatly from remarks by a referee of the paper \cite{Koppensteiner:pre:ExactFunctorsOnPerverseCoherentSheaves}.

Northwestern University's Mathematics Department has provided an exceptional environment and I would like to thank everyone involved for their work in keeping it this way.
I have learned much from the faculty (current and former) and my fellow graduate students alike.

I am very happy to have some wonderful friends, even though I see many of them way too rarely.
Especially this includes Ira, who went from saying \enquote{hi} a couple of times a week to so much more in these years.
Finally, I am particularly grateful for all the support I have received from my family despite our ever-growing physical distance.
